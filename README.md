# Hello Vue.js!

This repo is my Hello World version of Vue.js! It is meant to be used for demo purposes and a quick overview of just how awesome it is. ðŸ˜Ž

This repo contains two versions of the same app:

1. Built with only the minified CDN which has been included in the repo in order to minimize dependencies on WiFi
2. Built with the Vue CLI in order to provide an overview of what a standard Vue.js project is like
