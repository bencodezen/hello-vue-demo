# Hello Vue.js!

This repo is my Hello World version of Vue.js! It is meant to be used for demo purposes and a quick overview of just how awesome it is. ðŸ˜Ž

## Content

This repo contains two versions of the same app:

1. Built with only the minified CDN which has been included in the repo in order to minimize dependencies on WiFi
2. Built with the Vue CLI in order to provide an overview of what a standard Vue.js project is like

### Simple CDN Version

There are two primary files in here:

1. `hello-vuejs.html` - starting point for the app
2. `hello-vuejs-finished.html` - the finished version of the app

### Vue CLI Version

Once you open the `./vue-cli` in your terminal, you can run the following to get a local web development environment setup.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run local web server
npm run serve
```
